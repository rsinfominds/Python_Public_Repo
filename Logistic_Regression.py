# Machine learning program to detect the a submarine is crossing a rock or mine.
# Submarine has sonar which sends sound signal and collects the data to decide whether its travelling on a rock or mine.
# Sonar Data -> Is collected from a lab setup from a metal cylinder and rock.
# Flow:
# Sonar Data -> Feed -> Machine learning model.
# We are going to use Logistic Regression Model as we are using binary mode ROCK or MINE.
# The logistic model is used to model the probability of a certain class or event existing such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick.
# This is a supervised model.
# Flow: 
# Sonar Data -> Pre process -> Train and Test split -> Apply Logistic Regression Model -> Becomes Trained Logistic Regression Model <- Test with new sonar data.
# What is logistic regression?
# Logistic regression models the probabilities for classification problems with two possible outcomes. Itâ€™s an extension of the linear regression model for classification problems.
# Logistic regression is a statistical method for predicting binary classes. The outcome or target variable is dichotomous in nature. Dichotomous means there are only two possible classes
